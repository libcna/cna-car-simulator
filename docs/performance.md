# Performance notes

Measured with `--benchmark --frames 400 --auto-drive 8` (statistics start after 30 warm-up
frames) on the development container: Xvfb + Mesa llvmpipe **software** OpenGL ES 3.2, four
CPU threads, 1280 x 720, sample map "Lipová", spawn "square", chase camera, traffic enabled.
Software rasterisation dominates these numbers; a discrete or integrated GPU renders the same
frame in a few milliseconds, so the wall-clock figures below are an upper bound that mainly
tracks triangle and draw-call counts.

| Build state | update avg | draw submission avg | frame wall avg | draw calls | triangles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before terrain LOD (all chunks full resolution) | 0.48 ms | 93.6 ms | 232.6 ms | 615 | 828k |
| Terrain LOD (steps 1/2/4 at 420 m / 1000 m, cull 2300 m) | 0.43 ms | 47.0 ms | 133.1 ms | 541 | 231k |

Load time on the same machine: map data 0.5 s (terrain conformance dominates), world
geometry 3.1 s (three terrain LODs, 44k tree cards, 356 buildings), total about 4 s to the
first frame.

## Where the time goes

- `Update` (physics at 120 Hz sub-steps, traffic, collision, audio mixing) stays below 0.5 ms.
- Draw submission is dominated by the number of batches: roads (71), buildings/props in 256 m
  chunks (up to ~180 visible), tree batches per chunk and species, traffic cars (about 25
  parts each). Frustum culling and the tree distance cut (1100 m) are the main reducers.
- The cockpit view adds the rear-view mirror pass (sky + world + vehicles again at 768 x 200)
  and the instrument cluster (SpriteBatch into a 1024 x 448 target).

## Levers that remain (PERF-002)

1. Merge building/prop batches per chunk across materials with a small texture atlas
   (would cut object draw calls roughly by four).
2. Instanced trees (`DrawInstancedPrimitives` with the BlendWeight instance stream) instead of
   per-chunk static meshes; a single-quad far LOD beyond 500 m.
3. Mirror pass at half rate or lower resolution as a setting.
4. Road strips: one buffer per surface material instead of per piece.
